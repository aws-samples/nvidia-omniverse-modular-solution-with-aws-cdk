## Overview 
NVIDIA Omniverse is a scalable, multi-GPU, real-time, collaboration platform for building and operating 3D applications, based on Pixar's Universal Scene Description (USD) and NVIDIA RTX technology. USD is a powerful, extensible 3D framework and ecosystem that enables 3D designers and developers to connect and collaborate between industry-leading 3D content creation, rendering, and simulation applications. Omniverse helps individual creators and teams to connect and enhance their 3D artistic process, and enterprises to build and simulate large-scale virtual worlds for industrial applications.

Omniverse engages everyone involved in the lifecycle of 3D data with access to high-quality visualizations, authoring, and review tools. Teams do not need additional overhead to manage complex 3D data pipelines. Instead, they can focus on their unique contributions to bring value to the market. Non-technical stakeholders are able to gain valuable business insights from 3D data without the historically steep learning curve common to 3D applications.
